After graduated in 2019, I entered another stage of my life \u2013 working in Guangdong Hotel where located in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. Thanks to the teachers of SBHM who cultivated me into a thoughtful and understandable hotelier, which gave me the opportunity to learn and apply for it. The programme provided me with a solid foundation such as how to solve problems from different points of view. Teachers also taught me which method to solve problems in terms of professional and applicable. It gives strength for me to overcome my fears when working in the new environment. This also cultivates me to face the realistic world by reinforcing my knowledges. Thus, it enhances my self-worth by solving various problems in the workplace. Students who do not have hotel work experience can choose the front desk as the starting point of their career journey. This position plays more roles and functions than we imagined. Then, you should know my first job was a receptionist in the hotel. If you think that the front desk can only help guests to check in and out, it is quite a misunderstanding. Helping guests check-in and check-out would be just the most basic task. The front desk is not only a facade of the hotel, but also an important bridge between the hotel and the guests. It is also a seasoning between the internal departments of the hotel. A qualified staff must handle and coordinate both internal and external relations, so that all hotel departments can be connected together to provide consumers with high-quality services. When it comes to the service industry, many people have different opinions. The general environment is not an excuse.

In recent years, my research focuses on the understanding and processing of 2D non-photorealistic contents with deep learning techniques. Especially, I wrote several papers on the processing of ACG (animation, comics, games) contents and some of them are accepted by top venues such as ACM SIGGRAPH. I am also interested in some other computer vision and graphics topics, such as computational photography, deep image semantic understanding, visualization, and human-computer interaction.

I also worked as an (Acting) Postdoctoral Fellow in the CUHK Jockey Club AI for the Future Project, which aims at promoting AI education to middle school students and teachers.

I received my B.Eng. degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2013, and Ph.D. degree from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2020. In recent years, my research focuses on the understanding and processing of 2D non-photorealistic contents with deep learning techniques. Especially, I wrote several papers on the processing of ACG (animation, comics, games) contents and some of them are accepted by top venues such as ACM SIGGRAPH. I am also interested in some other computer vision and graphics topics, such as computational photography, deep image semantic understanding, visualization, and human-computer interaction. I write production codes for my research projects, and some of them are available on the internet. Besides, I also know some frontend programming\u2014one of my favourite works is the frontend design of the USTC Open Source Mirror.", "teaching": "Before I joined CIHE, I worked as course tutors and was responsible for the tutorial sessions, course practices, homework, and examinations of multiple courses in CUHK, including: Introduction to Engineering Design (CSE fundamentals), Computer Principles and Java Programming (CSE Fundamentals, outstanding TA award), Introduction to Multimedia Systems, Building Web Applications, Design & Analysis of Algorithm, Network and Web Programming (PG Course), GPU Programming (PG Course). I also worked as an (Acting) Postdoctoral Fellow in the CUHK Jockey Club AI for the Future Project, which aims at promoting AI education to middle school students and teachers. In this project, I was responsible for the course design of AI curriculums. I also designed a set of corresponding AI laboratory sessions and materials in software and hardware platforms for the project.", "research": "My research interests include 2D non-photorealistic graphics, computational photography, image and video processing, and HCI. In recent years, I worked together with my colleges and the ACG (2-dimensional media) community to research real-life challenges in the production of comics, illustrations, and animations. Meanwhile, we also developed various applications towards user-friendly and efficient processing in the comics and animation pipeline to save the production cost. I am currently a professional member of ACM.
